- InstantShare does not have the edit/delete features. But you can do it from [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) or Azure Storage Explorer in Azure portal.
- You can customize the appearance by edit index.html file and re-upload it.
- We recommend that use InstantShare with URL shortening services because InstantShare's URL is long.
